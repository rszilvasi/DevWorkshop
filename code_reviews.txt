A "good" code review is the one titled "Parking Lot OO Design 
(Python)." The submitter explained the requirements of their 
code and also used meaningful name for their variables. In addition, 
there is a lot of communication between submitter and reviewer. The 
reviewer divides their critics into sections, which make it easier 
for the submitter to understand.

A "bad" code review is the one titled "Rust minesweeper grid 
generator code design." No one has reviewed their yet, however, 
their code is a little messy with not many meaningful names to 
their variables. In addition, the submitter didn't really provide 
an explanation for their code, which would make it hard for a 
reviewer to examine. I would suggest to the submitter to add more
comments or explanation.
